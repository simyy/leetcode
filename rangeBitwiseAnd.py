"""
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:

Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: [0,1]
Output: 0

Analysize:

First, the simplest method is traverse of range, but result is faild (timeout!!!).
Second,  this is a  bitwise question, which often use binary shift method, so i find below rules:

1. range(m, n) is a continue numbers.
2. m and n have a common prefix number.
3. every +1 must cause a zero on rightmost positionã€‚

so, find the common prefix, and recover shift, then will find the result.
