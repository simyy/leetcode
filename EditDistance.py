"""
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character

Analysis:
DP solution.
1. if word1 or word2 is zero, then stop, return max length;
2. make a matrix which means distance between word[:i] and word[:j] 
   the matrix_i_0 is i where i in len(word1) + 1, and the matrix_0_j is j where j in len(word2) + 1
3. after init matrix, then cmp word[i] and word[j] where i < len(word1) + 1 and j < len(word2)+ 1ï¼Œ
   if word[i] == word[j], then dis between word[:i] and word[:j] must equal matrix[i-1][j-1]
   else dis equal min(matrix[i-1][j-1], matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1])
4. matrix[i][j] is result
